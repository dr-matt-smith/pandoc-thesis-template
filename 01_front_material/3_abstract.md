GUIDE TO STUDENTS: An abstract is a brief overview of the project. Ideally it should fit onto a single page.

This project tackled the problem of creating a computer-based tool to model and manipulate music. The problem to be solved was how to create a computer tool that is easy to use but that also allows for non-trivial musical actions to be made on the computer. In this report a description is presented of the specification and analysis of the problem, the review of relevant research conducted, and the life cycle of the system that was developed to solve the problem.

Key features of the developed system, called “Pitch Circles”, including its basis in a respected music theory, its development in an object-oriented programming language – Java 2, and the evaluation of the system from an HCI (Human Computer Interaction) perspective, in additional to more traditional functional testing.

The result is a simple, but powerful tool for basic musical tasks, that is easy to learn while elegantly modelling the symmetric and asymmetric features of the Western Diatonic music system. With the Pitch Circles tool novices users can identify the relationship between triadic chords and different regions (scales), and use simple rules for movement around the tonal circles to derive and apply fundamental musical principles including the chromatic and diatonic circles of fifths.
